# My Vim Config

I like vim as a lightweight editor,
so it will be a minimal config of vim. It contains

- Everyone vim configuration.
- Basic support, such as indention and syntax highlighting,
  for many languages.
- Some shortcuts.

## Install

``` bash
$ rm -r ~/.vim ~/.vimrc
$ git clone https://github.com/0kaguya/vimrc.git ~/.vim
$ vim
```

Wait until all plugins installed, then type `:q!` to quit vim.
If you are running a Windows machine, use `~/vimfiles` instead of `~/.vim`.
