# My Vim Config

My own ideas of vim are all about *quick and lightweight editing*. thus
it will be a minimal config of vim. This config contains:

- Commonly used vim configuration.
- Basic language supports such as syntax highlighting.
- *Tons of shortcut*.


## Install

If you have a \*unix environment, run these commands in your terminal. And,
if you are using a Windows machine, use `~/vimfiles` instead of `~/.vim` in your powershell.

``` bash
$ rm -r ~/.vim ~/.vimrc
$ git clone https://github.com/0kaguya/vimrc.git ~/.vim
$ vim
```

Wait until all plugins installed, then type `:wq` to quit vim:)
