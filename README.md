# My Vim Config

my own ideas about vim are all of *quick and lightweight editing*. thus
it will be a minimal configuration for vim. it contains:

- commonly used vim configuration.
- basic language supports such as syntax highlighting.
- **tons of shortcut**.


## Install

#### Dependencies

- vim/gvim
- git
- xsel

assume you are at \*unix environment. run command in terminal:

``` bash
$ rm -rf ~/.vim ~/.vimrc
$ git clone https://github.com/0kaguya/vimrc.git ~/.vim
```

after that, open vim and wait until all plugins are installed.
