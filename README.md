# My Vim Config

my own ideas about vim are all of *quick and lightweight editing*. thus
it will be a minimal configuration for vim. it contains:

- commonly used vim configuration.
- basic language supports such as syntax highlighting.
- **tons of shortcut**.


## Install

if you have a \*unix environment, run these commands in your terminal.
if you are using windows machine, use `~/vimfiles` instead of `~/.vim` in your powershell.

``` bash
$ rm -r ~/.vim ~/.vimrc
$ git clone https://github.com/0kaguya/vimrc.git ~/.vim
$ vim
```

you can wait until all plugins installed.
