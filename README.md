# My Vim Config

I treat a vim as a lightweight editor,
so it will be a minimal config. There are:

- Common out-of-box vim configuration.
- Basic support, such as indention and syntax highlighting,
  for many languages.
- Some shortcuts. (not maintained for a while.)

## Install

``` bash
$ rm -r ~/.vim ~/.vimrc
$ git clone https://github.com/0kaguya/.vim ~/.vim
$ vim +PlugInstall +qall
```

If you are running a Windows machine, type `~/vimfiles` instead of `~/.vim`.
